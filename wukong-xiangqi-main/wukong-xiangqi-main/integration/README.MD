# Integrating Wukong Xiangqi with 3rd party websites
Here I'm presenting the version of Wukong that is adopted to<br>
be integrated with GUIs of the 3rd party websites. Please make<br>
sure to use the source code from the link below if you want to<br>
reuse Wukong in your projects. Note that this version is different<br>
from those running online or used for interactive XIangqi apps.
